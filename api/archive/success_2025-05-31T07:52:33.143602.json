Liam has 105 total credits and has completed the prerequisite courses, so he meets the credit requirement. Step 2: Using Premise 6, Liam submitted the registration form on 22/07/2025, which is after the deadline specified in Premise 1. Step 3: Using Premise 4, late registration (after 20/07/2025) incurs a $200 penalty, but enrollment is allowed if all prerequisites are met. Since Liam submitted his form after the deadline, he will incur the penalty. Step 4: Based on the above steps, Liam cannot enroll in the capstone course without paying a penalty because he submitted his registration form after the deadline. Final Step: The answer is No."

Step 2: Using Premise 2: \"A student is on academic probation if they have a low GPA from the previous semester.\" - Since Emma has a low GPA from the previous semester, she is on academic probation. Step 3: Using Premise 3: \"Students on academic probation can enroll if they obtain a faculty waiver by 10/08/2025.\" - Emma needs a faculty waiver by 10/08/2025 to enroll in the advanced workshop despite being on academic probation. Step 4: Using Premise 4: \"Emma has completed all core courses, has a low GPA last semester, and has no faculty waiver.\" - Emma currently does not have a faculty waiver. Step 5: Combining Premises 3 and 4: Emma cannot enroll in the advanced workshop if she obtains a faculty waiver after 10/08/2025 because the waiver must be obtained by 10/08/2025. Final Step: The answer is No. Emma cannot enroll in the advanced workshop if she obtains a faculty waiver after 10/08/2025."

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.Option A is incorrect because while Ava has completed all prerequisite courses, this alone does not satisfy the full set of enrollment criteria.

Additionally, she lacks advisor consent, which is another requirement.Option D is incorrect because it misinterprets the status of Ava's prerequisite courses.
