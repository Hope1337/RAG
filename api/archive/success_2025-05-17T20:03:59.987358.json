Step 2: Using Premise 2: \"If an individual is a philosopher, then they are thoughtful.\" - Since every individual is a philosopher (from Step 1), it follows that every individual is thoughtful. Step 3: Using Premise 3: \"There exists an individual who is a scholar.\" - This confirms that at least one individual is a scholar. Step 4: Combining Steps 1 and 3: Since every individual is a philosopher (Step 1) and there exists at least one scholar (Step 3), it follows that at least one scholar is a philosopher. Step 5: Using Premise 2 again: \"If an individual is a philosopher, then they are thoughtful.\" - Since at least one scholar is a philosopher (from Step 4), it follows that at least one scholar is thoughtful. Final Step: Based on the above steps, we can conclude that if there is at least one scholar, then there is at least one thoughtful individual. Therefore, the answer is Yes."

This makes Cross-Entropy Loss the most suitable choice for a deep learning classification task that needs to penalize confident wrong predictions.Option A) MSE is not suitable for this scenario because, as stated in Premise 4, MSE is sensitive to outliers due to its squaring of differences, which does not directly address the need to penalize confident wrong predictions. Option B) Huber Loss, as mentioned in Premise 5, is designed to be less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE but does not specifically address the need to penalize confident wrong predictions, which is a key requirement for classification tasks.Option D) Hinge Loss, while used in certain classification tasks, is not mentioned in the premises as being particularly effective for penalizing confident wrong predictions.

      "explanation": "Noah's enrollment attempt will be denied due to an incomplete grade and the lack of a resolution form. According to Premise 1, students can only enroll in the research workshop if they have completed all required preparatory courses and have a clear academic standing. Premise 2 states that a student has a clear academic standing only if they have no incomplete grades from the previous semester. Since Noah has one incomplete grade, he does not meet this requirement. Additionally, Premise 4 indicates that students with incomplete grades can enroll if they submit a grade resolution form by 25/07/2025, but Noah did not submit such a form. Premise 5 confirms that Noah has completed all preparatory courses, but this alone is insufficient to allow him to enroll since he still has an incomplete grade and no resolution form. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.Option A is incorrect because even though Noah has completed all preparatory courses, he does not have a clear academic standing due to his incomplete grade. Option C is incorrect because Noah cannot verify his courses after the deadline; the deadline for verifying courses is 01/08/2025, and he did not submit a resolution form by 25/07/2025. Option D is also incorrect because Noah has completed all preparatory courses, so the issue is not with the completion status of his courses but rather with his incomplete grade and lack of a resolution form."
