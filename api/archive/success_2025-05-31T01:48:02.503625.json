      "explanation": "To determine Duy's total cost and eligibility for on-time graduation, we need to carefully analyze the given premises and follow the steps outlined in the reference example.\n\n#### 1. **Total Cost Calculation:**\n   - **HT Removal Fees:**\n     - Statistics: $50\n     - Economics: $50\n     - Total HT removal fees: $50 + $50 = $100\n   - **English Test Fee:**\n     - $30\n   - **Total Cost:**\n     - $100 (HT removal) + $30 (English test) = $130\n\n#### 2. **Eligibility for On-Time Graduation:**\n   - **Credits Requirement:**\n     - Duy needs at least 45 credits.\n     - Current credits: 42\n     - Additional credits from HT removal:\n       - Statistics: (85/100) * 3 = 2.55 credits\n       - Economics: (55/100) * 3 = 1.65 credits (but since the score is less than 60, it contributes 0 credits)\n     - Total credits: 42 + 2.55 + 0 = 44.55 credits (which is less than 45 credits)\n\n   - **Course Scores Requirement:**\n     - All courses must be scored ≥ 60/100.\n     - Statistics: 85 (meets requirement)\n     - Economics: 55 (does not meet requirement)\n\n   - **English Test Score Requirement:**\n     - English test score must be ≥ 75/100.\n     - Duy's score: 80 (meets requirement)\n     - Release date: 25/06/2025 + 10 days = 05/07/2025 (misses the deadline of 30/06/2025)\n\n   - **HT Resolution Deadline:**\n     - HTs must be resolved by 15/06/2025.\n     - Statistics: 10/06/2025 (meets deadline)\n     - Economics: 12/06/2025 (meets deadline)\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Total Cost:** $130\n- **Eligibility for On-Time Graduation:** No (due to insufficient credits, failing Economics score, and missing the English test result deadline)"
