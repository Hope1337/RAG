    - Logical conditions or rules (e.g., ‚Äúif‚Ä¶then‚Ä¶‚Äù)
    - Do not perform inference in this step
Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
  - Use the extracted facts to reason toward the answer.
  - At each step:
    - Clearly state what is being concluded.
    - Cite the exact premise(s) used or refer to earlier steps.
    - Avoid skipping logical steps or assuming information not provided.
Step 3: Finalize answer and put your response to following format:
```

Field description:
  - `{answer}`: The final concise answer, answer only is your choice letter. (e.g. 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D')
  - `{explanation}`: Your reasoning text written in natural language, clearly referring to the source premises (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom Premise 2, we know that‚Ä¶‚Äù).
  - `{idx}`: A comma-separated list of the premise numbers (from `Premise #X`) that support the final answer.


## Premises:
    - Premise 1: Every individual is a philosopher. 
    - Premise 2: If an individual is a philosopher, then they are thoughtful. 
    - Premise 3: There exists an individual who is a scholar. 
    - Premise 4: Every individual is quiet. 
    - Premise 5: If an individual is quiet, then they are rational. 


## Question: Do the premises allow us to conclude that if there is at least one scholar, then there is at least one thoughtful individual?
A. Yes, if there is a scholar, there is a thoughtful individual.
B. No, this cannot be concluded.
C. The premises lead to a contradiction about scholars and thoughtful individuals.
D. Every thoughtful individual must be a scholar. 


### Step 1: Analyze the Premises
- **Premise 1**: Every individual is a philosopher.
- **Premise 2**: If an individual is a philosopher, then they are thoughtful.
- **Premise 3**: There exists an individual who is a scholar.
- **Premise 4**: Every individual is quiet.
- **Premise 5**: If an individual is quiet, then they are rational.

### Step 2: Perform Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. From **Premise 1**, we know that every individual is a philosopher.
2. From **Premise 2**, if an individual is a philosopher, then they are thoughtful.
   - Combining these two premises, we can conclude that every individual is thoughtful.
3. From **Premise 3**, there exists at least one individual who is a scholar.
4. Since every individual is thoughtful (from steps 1 and 2), the existence of a scholar implies the existence of a thoughtful individual.

### Step 3: Finalize Answer
Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that if there is at least one scholar, then there is at least one thoughtful individual.

```
<response>
    <answer>A</answer>
    <explanation>From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that every individual is a philosopher and therefore thoughtful. Given that there exists at least one scholar (Premise 3), this scholar is also thoughtful.</explanation>

    - Premise 1: Every economy is regulated. 
    - Premise 2: If an economy is not regulated, it cannot maintain public trust. 
    - Premise 3: Every economy adopts sustainable practices. 
    - Premise 4: If there exists a sustainable economy, then regulation prevents distrust in all economies. 
    - Premise 5: Some economies show GDP growth. 


## Question: Do the premises allow us to conclude that the existence of sustainable economies ensures that regulation prevents distrust in all economies?
A. Yes, sustainable economies imply regulation prevents distrust universally.
B. No, this cannot be concluded.
C. The premises are contradictory about sustainability and regulation.
D. Sustainable economies imply no regulation is needed. 


Step 1: Analyze the Premises:
- From Premise 1: Every economy is regulated.
- From Premise 2: If an economy is not regulated, it cannot maintain public trust.
- From Premise 3: Every economy adopts sustainable practices.
- From Premise 4: If there exists a sustainable economy, then regulation prevents distrust in all economies.
- From Premise 5: Some economies show GDP growth.

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- From Premise 4, if there exists a sustainable economy, then regulation prevents distrust in all economies.
- From Premise 3, every economy adopts sustainable practices, which means there exist sustainable economies.
- Therefore, from Premise 4 and the fact that there exist sustainable economies, we can conclude that regulation prevents distrust in all economies.

Step 3: Finalize answer.

  - `{idx}`: A comma-separated list of the premise numbers (from `Premise #X`) that support the final answer.


## Premises:
    - Premise 1: Students can register for advanced courses only if they have completed all prerequisite courses and paid the registration fee by 15/08/2025. 
    - Premise 2: Each advanced course requires 3 prerequisite courses, each worth 4 credits. 
    - Premise 3: A registration fee of $50 per credit is charged for advanced courses, payable by the deadline. 
    - Premise 4: If a student misses the fee deadline but completes prerequisites, they can register late with a $100 penalty per course. 
    - Premise 5: The system rejects registrations if any prerequisite course is incomplete, regardless of fee payment. 
    - Premise 6: A student, Alex, has completed 8 prerequisite courses (32 credits) and paid $600 for 3 advanced courses (4 credits each) on 16/08/2025. 


## Question: Alex attempts to register for 3 advanced courses (4 credits each) on 16/08/2025. What is the total cost, including penalties, for his registration?
A. $600, no penalties, as prerequisites are met.
B. $900, including $100 penalty per course for late payment.
C. $600, but registration is rejected due to late payment.
D. $700, with a single $100 penalty for late registration. 


Step 1: Analyze the Premises:
- From Premise 1, students must complete all prerequisites and pay the registration fee by 15/08/2025 to register for advanced courses.
- From Premise 2, each advanced course requires 3 prerequisite courses, each worth 4 credits.
- From Premise 3, the registration fee is $50 per credit, payable by the deadline.
- From Premise 4, if a student misses the fee deadline but completes prerequisites, they can register late with a $100 penalty per course.
- From Premise 5, the system rejects registrations if any prerequisite course is incomplete, regardless of fee payment.
- From Premise 6, Alex has completed 8 prerequisite courses (32 credits) and paid $600 for 3 advanced courses (4 credits each) on 16/08/2025.

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- According to Premise 6, Alex has completed 8 prerequisite courses, which is more than enough for the 3 advanced courses he wants to take (each requiring 3 prerequisite courses). Therefore, the prerequisites are met.
- However, Alex paid the fee on 16/08/2025, which is after the deadline of 15/08/2025 specified in Premise 1.
- Since Alex missed the deadline but has completed the prerequisites, Premise 4 applies. He can still register but will incur a $100 penalty per course.
- The cost for the 3 advanced courses is $600 (as stated in Premise 6), plus a $100 penalty per course for a total of $300 in penalties.
- Therefore, the total cost is $600 + $300 = $900.

Step 3: Finalize answer.
```
<response>
    <answer>B</answer>
    <explanation>Alex's registration is allowed with a penalty because he has completed the prerequisites but missed the payment deadline. The total cost is $900, including $100 penalty per course for late payment.</explanation>

## Question: Can we conclude that every school offers advanced math courses?
A. Yes, every school offers advanced math courses.
B. No, not every school offers advanced math courses.
C. The premises are contradictory about advanced math courses. 


Step 1: Analyze the Premises:
- From Premise 1, we know that some schools offer advanced math courses.
- From Premise 2, if a school offers advanced math courses, then it must have qualified teachers.
- From Premise 3, if a school does not have qualified teachers, it cannot offer advanced math courses.
- From Premise 4, there exists at least one school that does not have qualified teachers.

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- From Premise 4, we know there is at least one school without qualified teachers.
- According to Premise 3, since this school does not have qualified teachers, it cannot offer advanced math courses.
- Therefore, not all schools can offer advanced math courses because at least one school cannot due to the lack of qualified teachers.

Step 3: Finalize answer.

    - Premise 3: If a student does not have safety training, they cannot attend lab sessions. 
    - Premise 4: There exists a student who does not have safety training. 


## Question: Can we conclude that every student takes biology?
A. Yes, every student takes biology.
B. No, not every student takes biology.
C. The premises are contradictory about biology enrollment.

<response>
    <answer>B</answer>
    <explanation>
        From Premise 1, we know that some students take biology, but not necessarily all students. This implies that there could be students who do not take biology. 
        From Premise 4, we know that there exists at least one student who does not have safety training. According to Premise 3, this student cannot attend lab sessions. And from Premise 2, attending lab sessions is a requirement for taking biology. Therefore, this student cannot take biology.
        Since we have established that there is at least one student who cannot take biology, we can conclude that not every student takes biology.

## Premises:
    - Premise 1: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems convert written text into spoken words. 
    - Premise 2: Voice Conversion (VC) technology alters a speaker's voice to sound like another speaker. 
    - Premise 3: TTS systems include concatenative, parametric, and neural network-based types. 
    - Premise 4: VC is used for applications such as voice anonymization and dubbing. 
    - Premise 5: Neural network-based TTS systems often rely on models like WaveNet. 
    - Premise 6: VC systems must preserve the linguistic content of the original speech. 
    - Premise 7: Concatenative TTS systems use pre-recorded speech segments to generate output. 
    - Premise 8: Voice anonymization changes a speaker's identity in audio. 


## Question: Which of the following is true about Voice Conversion technology? A) It converts text to speech. B) It changes a speaker's voice while keeping the message intact. C) It relies on pre-recorded speech segments. D) It generates speech using WaveNet.

    <answer>B</answer>
    <explanation>
        From Premise 2, we know that Voice Conversion (VC) technology alters a speaker's voice to sound like another speaker. From Premise 6, we understand that VC systems must preserve the linguistic content of the original speech. This means that while the voice changes, the message remains intact. Therefore, option B is correct.

    - Premise 3: Classification problems typically employ loss functions such as Hinge Loss or Cross-Entropy Loss. 
    - Premise 4: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is sensitive to outliers because it squares the differences between predicted and actual values. 
    - Premise 5: Huber Loss combines properties of MSE and MAE, making it less sensitive to outliers than MSE. 
    - Premise 6: Cross-Entropy Loss is effective because it penalizes confident and incorrect predictions heavily. 
    - Premise 7: In deep learning, the loss function guides the gradient descent algorithm to minimize prediction errors. 
    - Premise 8: The choice of loss function can affect a model's robustness and convergence speed during training.

## Premises:
    - Premise 1: The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that uses linear algebra for encryption and decryption. 
    - Premise 2: In the Hill cipher, the key is a square matrix that must be invertible modulo the size of the alphabet. 
    - Premise 3: The determinant of the key matrix must be non-zero and coprime with the modulus for the matrix to be invertible. 
    - Premise 4: The Hill cipher encrypts a plaintext vector by multiplying it with the key matrix modulo the alphabet size. 
    - Premise 5: Decryption in the Hill cipher involves multiplying the ciphertext vector by the inverse of the key matrix modulo the alphabet size. 
    - Premise 6: If the determinant of the key matrix is zero, the matrix is not invertible, and decryption is impossible. 
    - Premise 7: For a 2x2 matrix, the inverse exists if the determinant is non-zero and coprime with the modulus. 
    - Premise 8: The Hill cipher can be broken if the key matrix is not chosen carefully, as it is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks. 


## Question: Which of the following is true about the Hill cipher? A) It uses a non-square matrix for encryption. B) The key matrix must have a determinant of zero. C) It is secure against all types of attacks. D) The key matrix must be invertible modulo the alphabet size. 


```
<response>
    <answer>D</answer>
    <explanation>The correct answer is D. According to Premise 2, "In the Hill cipher, the key is a square matrix that must be invertible modulo the alphabet size." This directly supports option D. Option A contradicts Premise 2 since the key matrix must be square. Option B contradicts Premise 6 which states that if the determinant of the key matrix is zero, the matrix is not invertible, and decryption is impossible. Option C is incorrect because Premise 8 indicates that the Hill cipher can be broken if the key matrix is not chosen carefully, making it vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks.</explanation>

        From Premise 1, students can enroll in the research workshop only if they have completed all required preparatory courses and have a clear academic standing. 
        From Premise 2, a student has a clear academic standing only if they have no incomplete grades from the previous semester. 
        From Premise 5, Noah has completed all preparatory courses but also has one incomplete grade and did not submit a grade resolution form. 
        According to Premise 4, students with incomplete grades can enroll if they submit a grade resolution form by 25/07/2025. Since Noah did not submit a grade resolution form, he does not meet the requirement for having a clear academic standing. Therefore, Noah is denied enrollment due to an incomplete grade and lack of a resolution form.

    <answer>B</answer>
    <explanation>
        From Premise 1, students can enroll in a capstone course only if they have completed all foundational courses and have no academic holds. Noah has completed all foundational courses but has an academic hold due to failing to complete an advising session last semester (Premise 4). According to Premise 2, this failure results in an academic hold. Additionally, Premise 3 states that students with academic holds can enroll if they submit a hold release form by 05/08/2025, but Noah has not submitted such a form (Premise 4). Therefore, Noah is denied enrollment due to his academic hold and lack of a hold release form.

  - `{explanation}`: Your reasoning text written in natural language, clearly referring to the source premises (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom Premise 2, we know that‚Ä¶‚Äù).
  - `{idx}`: A comma-separated list of the premise numbers (from `Premise #X`) that support the final answer.


## Premises:
    - Premise 1: Students can enroll in a thesis seminar only if they have completed all prerequisite courses, are not on academic probation, and have advisor consent. 
    - Premise 2: A student is on academic probation if they have any unexcused absences in the previous semester. 
    - Premise 3: Advisor consent requires a signed approval form submitted by 15/08/2025. 
    - Premise 4: Students on academic probation can enroll if they submit a probation clearance form by 10/08/2025, even without advisor consent. 
    - Premise 5: A student, Ava, has completed all prerequisite courses, has one unexcused absence, has no signed approval form, and has not submitted a probation clearance form. 


## Question: Ava attempts to enroll in the thesis seminar for the upcoming semester. What is the outcome of her enrollment attempt?
A. Ava is allowed to enroll because she completed all prerequisite courses.
B. Ava is denied enrollment due to her academic probation and lack of clearance or advisor consent.
C. Ava is allowed to enroll if she submits a signed approval form after the deadline.
D. Ava is denied enrollment because her prerequisite courses are incomplete.

    <explanation>
        From Premise 1, students can enroll in a thesis seminar only if they have completed all prerequisite courses, are not on academic probation, and have advisor consent. 
        From Premise 2, a student is on academic probation if they have any unexcused absences in the previous semester. Since Ava has one unexcused absence, she is on academic probation.
        From Premise 3, advisor consent requires a signed approval form submitted by 15/08/2025. Ava does not have a signed approval form.
        From Premise 4, students on academic probation can enroll if they submit a probation clearance form by 10/08/2025, even without advisor consent. However, Ava has not submitted a probation clearance form.
        Therefore, Ava is denied enrollment due to her academic probation and lack of clearance or advisor consent.

## Premises:
    - Premise 1: Every individual is a programmer. 
    - Premise 2: If an individual is a programmer, then they are a software engineer. 
    - Premise 3: If an individual is not a software engineer, then they are not a robot. 
    - Premise 4: There exists an individual who is a robot. 
    - Premise 5: If an individual is a robot, then they are a programmer. 


## Question: Do the premises allow us to conclude that if there is at least one robot, then there is at least one software engineer?
A. Yes, if there is a robot, there is a software engineer.
B. No, this cannot be concluded.
C. The premises lead to a contradiction about robots and software engineers.
D. Every robot must not be a software engineer. 


Step 1: Analyze the Premises:
- From Premise 1: Every individual is a programmer.
- From Premise 2: If an individual is a programmer, then they are a software engineer.
- From Premise 3: If an individual is not a software engineer, then they are not a robot.
- From Premise 4: There exists an individual who is a robot.
- From Premise 5: If an individual is a robot, then they are a programmer.

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- From Premise 4, we know there exists at least one robot.
- According to Premise 5, since there is at least one robot, this robot must also be a programmer.
- From Premise 1, every individual is a programmer, which includes our robot.
- From Premise 2, if an individual is a programmer, then they are a software engineer. Since the robot is a programmer, the robot must also be a software engineer.
- Therefore, if there is at least one robot, then there is at least one software engineer.

Step 3: Finalize answer.
```
<response>
    <answer>A</answer>
    <explanation>Based on the premises, if there is at least one robot, then this robot must be a programmer (Premise 5), and therefore a software engineer (Premise 2). Thus, the existence of a robot implies the existence of a software engineer.</explanation>

    - Premise 1: Every individual is a reptile. 
    - Premise 2: If an individual is not a reptile, then they are not a plant. 
    - Premise 3: Every individual is a plant. 
    - Premise 4: If an individual is a plant, then they are a species. 
    - Premise 5: There exists an individual who is a reptile. 


## Question: Do the premises allow us to conclude that if there is at least one reptile, then non-reptiles cannot be plants?
A. Yes, if there is a reptile, non-reptiles cannot be plants.
B. No, this cannot be concluded.
C. The premises lead to a contradiction about reptiles and plants.
D. Some non-reptiles must be plants. 


Step 1: Analyze the Premises:
- From Premise 1: Every individual is a reptile.
- From Premise 2: If an individual is not a reptile, then they are not a plant.
- From Premise 3: Every individual is a plant.
- From Premise 4: If an individual is a plant, then they are a species.
- From Premise 5: There exists an individual who is a reptile.

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- From Premise 1, we know that every individual is a reptile.
- From Premise 3, we also know that every individual is a plant.
- Since every individual is both a reptile and a plant, there cannot exist any non-reptile individuals because all individuals are reptiles.
- Therefore, the statement "non-reptiles cannot be plants" does not apply since there are no non-reptiles.
- This means that the conditional statement "if there is at least one reptile, then non-reptiles cannot be plants" cannot be evaluated as true or false based on the given premises because the existence of non-reptiles is precluded.

Step 3: Finalize answer.

    <answer>B</answer>
    <explanation>The premises do not allow us to conclude that if there is at least one reptile, then non-reptiles cannot be plants. This is because Premise 1 states that every individual is a reptile, which means there are no non-reptiles to consider. Thus, the conditional statement cannot be evaluated based on the given premises.</explanation>

Step 2: Perform step-by-step reasoning to answer the question.
- From Premise 1, we know that every student is a university student. This means there are no non-university students.
- Since there are no non-university students, Premise 4 does not apply because it talks about students who are not university students, which do not exist according to Premise 1.
- Therefore, the statement "non-university students are not programming students" is vacuously true since there are no non-university students to begin with.
- However, the question asks whether the existence of a qualified student (which we know from Premise 5) allows us to conclude that non-university students are not programming students. Given that there are no non-university students, this conclusion is not derived from the existence of a qualified student but rather from the fact that all students are university students.

Premise 3: For improvement retakes, use the highest score if ‚â• 4.0; if any attempt fails, deduct 0.3 points per credit from the course‚Äôs grade points.
Premise 4: A failed course (score < 4.0) contributes no credits.
Premise 5: Improvement retakes do not change accumulated credits.
Premise 6: A student has a GPA of 7.4 with 60 credits, including two courses: C1 (4 credits, original grade 6.8), C2 (3 credits, original grade 5.5).
Premise 7: For C1, the student retook for improvement three times, scoring 7.2, 3.5 (failed), 6.0.
Premise 8: For C2, the student retook for improvement twice, scoring 6.5, 7.0.
Premise 9: After C1‚Äôs failure, the student retook C1 (as a failed course) and scored 5.8.
Premise 10: The student took a new course, C3 (5 credits, scored 8.0).

Question: What is the student‚Äôs updated GPA after all course attempts?
Answer: 7.52
Explanation: Premise 6 gives a GPA of 7.4 over 60 credits, so grade points are 7.4 √ó 60 = 444, with C1 (4 credits, 6.8, points 27.2) and C2 (3 credits, 5.5, points 16.5), leaving 53 credits at 400.3 points. Premise 7 says C1 retakes scored 7.2, 3.5 (failed), 6.0; Premise 3 uses Max(6.8, 7.2, 3.5, 6.0) = 7.2, penalty 0.3 √ó 4 = 1.2 for failure, so points = 7.2 √ó 4 ‚àí 1.2 = 27.6, change = 27.6 ‚àí 27.2 = 0.4. Premise 8 says C2 retakes scored 6.5, 7.0; Max(5.5, 6.5, 7.0) = 7.0, no penalty, points = 7.0 √ó 3 = 21.0, change = 21.0 ‚àí 16.5 = 4.5. Premise 10 adds C3 (5 credits, 8.0, points 40). Total grade points: 400.3 + 27.6 + 21.0 + 40 = 488.9. Total credits (Premise 5): 60 + 5 = 65. GPA = 488.9 / 65 ‚âà 7.5215, rounded to 7.52.


Main Question: 
Premises: Premise 1: Students begin specialization before internships or projects.
Premise 2: Internship eligibility requires >= 80 credits, third year, and GPA >= 6.0 (scale 0-10).
Premise 3: Major-specific project requires internship completion, >= 90 credits, and >= 12 social work days.
Premise 4: Thesis eligibility requires >= 100 credits, >= 15 social work days, MOS certificate, and language certificate.
Premise 5: A failed course (grade < 4.0) contributes 0 credits.
Premise 6: Improvement retakes (passed courses) use the highest grade but add no credits.
Premise 7: Repeating a failed course adds credits if grade >= 4.0.
Premise 8: Graduation requires thesis completion, GPA >= 5.0, and >= 20 social work days.
Premise 9: A student has a GPA of 6.8 with 82 credits, including C1 (4 credits, grade 5.5, failed retake at 3.8), C2 (3 credits, grade 7.0).
Premise 10: The student took C3 (5 credits, grade 8.0), repeated C1 (grade 6.0), and took C4 (4 credits, grade 3.5, failed).

 Premises:Premise 1: Graduation requires ‚â• 130 credits, GPA ‚â• 5.5 (scale 0‚Äì10), ‚â• 120 CTXH hours, and a certificate.
Premise 2: Each course (‚â• 4.0 grade) contributes: 3 credits = 8 CTXH hours, 4 credits = 12 hours, 5 credits = 16 hours.
Premise 3: Failed courses (grade < 4.0) add 0 credits, 0 CTXH hours.
Premise 4: Social activities contribute CTXH: club = 20 hours, event = 10 hours; requires ‚â• 50 credits to join.
Premise 5: Students with GPA < 6.0 get 0.5 CTXH hours per credit instead of standard course hours.
Premise 6: A student has a GPA of 5.8 with 90 credits, 180 CTXH hours, no certificate, including C1 (3 credits, grade 6.0, CTXH 0), C2 (4 credits, grade 5.5, CTXH 0).
Premise 7: The student took C3 (5 credits, grade 7.0), C4 (3 credits, grade 3.8, failed), joined 2 clubs and 3 events.

Question: What is the student‚Äôs updated GPA after all courses and activities?
Answer: 5.86
Explanation: Premise 6 gives a GPA of 5.8, 90 credits, grade points 5.8 √ó 90 = 522.0, with C1 (3 credits, 6.0, points 18.0), C2 (4 credits, 5.5, points 22.0), other 83 credits at 482.0 points. Premise 7 adds: C3 (5 credits, 7.0, points 5 √ó 7.0 = 35.0), C4 (3 credits, 3.8, failed, 0 credits/points per Premise 3). Total credits: 90 + 5 = 95. Total grade points: 482.0 + 18.0 + 22.0 + 35.0 = 557.0. GPA = 557.0 / 95 ‚âà 5.86316, rounded to 5.86.
