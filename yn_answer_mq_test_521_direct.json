    "answer": "Uncertain",
    "idx": [],
    "explanation": "Step 1: Using Premise 2: \"If a dataset has missing values, then the model's performance decreases.\"\n- This premise directly states that missing values lead to decreased performance. However, it does not specify if this is always the case or if there are exceptions.\n\nStep 2: Using Premise 4: \"If a model performs well, then its dataset is properly preprocessed.\"\n- This implies that for a model to perform well, the dataset must be properly preprocessed, which includes handling missing values. Thus, well-performing models likely do not have missing values (or handle them appropriately).\n\nStep 3: Using Premise 5: \"If a dataset is not normalized, then it has missing values.\"\n- This premise establishes a relationship between normalization and missing values but does not directly address the impact of missing values on performance.\n\nStep 4: Using Premise 1: \"All machine learning models require data preprocessing.\"\n- This premise indicates that preprocessing is necessary for all models but does not provide specific details about the impact of missing values.\n\nStep 5: Using Premise 3: \"If a dataset is not normalized, then it affects model accuracy.\"\n- This suggests that not normalizing a dataset can negatively impact model accuracy, but it does not directly link this to missing values.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\n- The premises collectively suggest that missing values generally hurt performance and that well-performing models typically do not have missing values. However, they do not provide absolute certainty that missing values always hurt performance without exception. Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.",

While we know that all students have qualifications and understanding, there is no explicit statement that reasoning skills necessarily lead to understanding.\n\nFinal Step: Uncertain\n\nThe premises are insufficient to determine whether any student with reasoning skills has understanding.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Using Premise 4: \"If a student completes assignments on time, then they submit assignments on time.\"\n- This premise establishes a direct relationship between completing assignments on time and submitting them on time. However, it does not provide information about what happens if a student does not complete assignments on time.\n\nStep 2: Using Premise 5: \"If a student completes assignments on time, then they are prepared for the final exam.\"\n- This premise tells us that completing assignments on time leads to being prepared for the final exam. It does not provide information about what happens if a student does not complete assignments on time.\n\nStep 3: Using Premise 3: \"If a student understands the material, then they are prepared for the final exam.\"\n- This premise links understanding the material to being prepared for the final exam. It does not provide information about the reverse implication (i.e., not understanding the material).\n\nStep 4: Using Premise 2: \"If a student completes assignments on time, then they understand the course material.\"\n- This premise connects completing assignments on time to understanding the course material. However, it does not provide information about what happens if a student does not complete assignments on time.\n\nStep 5: Using Premise 1: \"Every student attends tutoring.\"\n- This premise states that all students attend tutoring but does not provide any direct link to assignment submission or preparation for the exam.\n\nStep 6: The premises do not provide any direct information about the relationship between not submitting assignments on time and not being prepared for the exam. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that not submitting assignments on time means a student is not prepared for the exam.\n\nFinal Step: Answer: Uncertain",

If any student did not pass the Algorithms course, they would not meet the requirements for the Software Engineering course, which contradicts Premise 4.\n\nFinal Step: Based on the above deductions, all students pass Algorithms.

    "explanation": "Step 1: Using Premise 3: Every security system provides video surveillance.\n- This premise directly states that all security systems include video surveillance.\n\nStep 2: Using Premise 4: If a security system provides video surveillance, then it integrates with smart home devices.\n- This premise establishes the condition that any security system providing video surveillance will integrate with smart home devices.\n\nStep 3: From Step 1 and Step 2, logically deduce that since every security system provides video surveillance (from Premise 3) and any security system providing video surveillance integrates with smart home devices (from Premise 4), it follows that every security system integrates with smart home devices.\n\nFinal Step: Therefore, the answer is Yes, every security system integrates with smart home devices.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Using Premise 16: \"Every drone has obstacle avoidance.\"\n- This directly states that for every drone \\( x \\), \\( O(x) \\) holds.\n- Therefore, \\( ∀x O(x) \\) is true according to this premise.\n\nStep 2: The statement to evaluate is \"¬∀x O(x)\".\n- This statement means \"Not all drones have obstacle avoidance.\"\n- Since Premise 16 explicitly states that every drone has obstacle avoidance, the statement \"¬∀x O(x)\" is false.\n\nFinal Step: The statement \"¬∀x O(x)\" is false. Therefore, the answer is No.",

    "explanation": "Step 1: Using Premise 4: \"If a VR headset is ergonomic, then it has a wide field of view.\"\n- This premise establishes that any ergonomic VR headset has a wide field of view.\n\nStep 2: Using Premise 5: \"If a VR headset has a wide field of view, then it has motion tracking.\"\n- This premise establishes that any VR headset with a wide field of view has motion tracking.\n\nStep 3: Logical Deduction\n- From Step 1, we know that any ergonomic VR headset has a wide field of view.\n- From Step 2, we know that any VR headset with a wide field of view has motion tracking.\n- Therefore, by combining these two premises, we can deduce that any ergonomic VR headset has motion tracking.\n\nFinal Step: Based on the logical deductions from the premises, every ergonomic VR headset has motion tracking.
