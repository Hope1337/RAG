Take a student who passes the exam—let’s call them Alex. Since Alex passes, Premise 8 says they study regularly. Premise 2 means that if they didn’t qualify for a scholarship, they wouldn’t study regularly, but since they do study regularly, they must qualify for a scholarship. Then, Premise 10 says that if they didn’t get a recommendation, they wouldn’t qualify, so because they qualify, Alex must have a recommendation letter. This applies to every student who passes, matching option A: every student who passes the exam receives a recommendation letter. Option B is incorrect because only students who study regularly or qualify attend tutoring, not necessarily everyone. Option C is incorrect because while some qualify (Premise 9), nothing confirms others don’t. Option D is incorrect because students who don’t pass may not qualify or get recommendations."

From premise 3, if a student earns language certification, then that student qualifies for international exchange programs (∀x (EarnsCertification(x) → QualifiesForExchange(x))). From premise 8, if not practicing with natives implies not completing immersion, then certification implies exchange qualification (∀x (¬PracticesWithNatives(x) → ¬CompletesImmersion(x)) → ∀x (EarnsCertification(x) → QualifiesForExchange(x))). Since premise 3 states the implication, and premise 4 states that there exists such a student, premise 8's consequent must be true. Therefore, if not practicing with natives implies not completing immersion, then certification implies exchange qualification (option C)."

From premise 1, if a student has completed the required prerequisite course, they are eligible to enroll in advanced courses (∀x (R(x) → U(x))). Since premise 4 states that all students must meet the eligibility requirements, and premise 1 states that completing the prerequisite course leads to eligibility, if all students must meet the eligibility requirements to enroll in the advanced courses, it follows that completing the prerequisite course implies eligibility for advanced courses (option B)."

So, any device with a motion sensor ends up being energy efficient, which matches option B: all devices with motion sensors are energy efficient. Option A is incorrect because Premise 2 says all app-compatible devices are energy efficient, so none can be compatible but not energy efficient. Option C is incorrect because a device could be energy efficient without being app-compatible or having a motion sensor—the information doesn’t force energy-efficient devices to have sensors. Option D is incorrect because Premise 3 only says devices without motion sensors aren’t app-compatible, but they could still be energy efficient some other way."

Option B is incorrect because the information says every book is frequently borrowed (Premise 19), and even if some weren’t, nothing says they’d be well-catalogued.

Take any dish—say, dish X—that’s available, which is every dish because of Premise 15. Since it’s available, Premise 5 says it’s popular. Now, Premise 12 means that if a dish isn’t recommended, it can’t be available, so because dish X is available, it must be recommended. So, dish X is both recommended and popular. This applies to every available dish, matching option A: every available dish is both recommended by the chef and popular. Option B is incorrect because every dish is available (Premise 15), so no dish is unavailable to be recommended. Option C is incorrect because every available dish is recommended (Premise 12), and all dishes are available, so no dish is both not recommended and popular. Option D is incorrect because every dish is spicy (Premise 13) and available, and available dishes are popular (Premise 5), so spicy dishes are popular, not the opposite."

Option A is incorrect because the information only talks about in-stock or popular products being shipped, not every single product. Option C is incorrect because, while in-stock products are premium quality and popular (Premises 1 and 4), we don’t know if premium quality products that aren’t in stock are popular.

    "explanation": "The given information tells us that every VR headset has high-resolution visuals (Premise 3) and that if a headset doesn’t have immersive sound, it doesn’t have high-resolution visuals (Premise 1). Since every headset has high-res visuals, let’s take any headset—say, headset Z. Premise 1 means that to have high-res visuals, a headset must have immersive sound, because lacking immersive sound would mean no high-res visuals, which isn’t possible. So, headset Z must have immersive sound. This applies to every headset, matching option A: every VR headset has immersive sound. Option B is incorrect because nothing says all headsets are ergonomic or have a wide field of view. Option C is incorrect because Premise 3 says all headsets have high-res visuals, so none lack them. Option D is incorrect because it contradicts option A—if all have immersive sound, none lack it."
