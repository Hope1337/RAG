Multiple signs indicate cheating: 95% identical answers with Student B (Premises 1, 26), submission 30 seconds apart (Premises 2, 27), completion in 15 minutes vs. a 40-minute class average (37.5% < 50%, Premises 3, 28), uncited rare terms (Premises 4, 29), and gaze deviation 12 times (Premises 5, 30). A prior cheating warning in December 2024 increases recurrence probability by 20% (Premises 6, 31). The AI detected cheating with 97% confidence (Premise 32), triggering a board meeting within 48 hours (Premises 8, 33), held on March 27, 2025, 10:00 AM, after the March 25 exam. Confirmation leads to suspension and a 0 score (Premise 7). A filed an appeal on March 28 (Premise 9, 34), but given the evidence, denial is likely, requiring a course retake and 30% tuition penalty (Premise 11). If camera footage provides further evidence, a 500,000 VND fine applies (Premise 25)."

    "explanation": "From premise 3 (Phong has accumulated 70 credits and has met the foreign language standard for year three), we know MeetsLanguageStandard(Phong, YearThree). From premise 14, third-year students can apply for study abroad if they meet the foreign language standard for year three (∀s (ThirdYear(s) ∧ MeetsLanguageStandard(s, YearThree) → EligibleStudyAbroad(s))). From premise 1, students are ranked as third-year if their accumulated credits are between 2M and 3M and they meet the language standard (∀s (ThirdYear(s) ↔ ((2M ≤ AccumulatedCredits(s) < 3M) ∧ MeetsLanguageStandard(s, YearThree)))). From premise 2, the average credits per year (M) for regular students is 33 (M = 33). Since premise 3 states that Phong has accumulated 70 credits, which is between 66 and 99, and he has met the language standard, premise 1's condition is satisfied, so Phong is a third-year student. Since premise 3 states that Phong has met the language standard, premise 14's conditions are met. Therefore, if Phong has met the foreign language standard for year three, it follows that Phong is eligible to apply for study abroad."

The given information says that if a device doesn’t have a motion sensor, it’s not compatible with smart home apps (Premise 3). This means that to be compatible with apps, a device must have a motion sensor, because lacking one prevents compatibility. The statement matches this idea: all app-compatible devices need motion sensors. To double-check, Premise 1 says devices with motion sensors are app-compatible, which supports the idea that motion sensors and app compatibility go together. Since Premise 3 confirms no app-compatible device can lack a motion sensor, the statement is true."

Premise 1 (∀x (EnergyEfficient(x) → CostEffective(x))) suggests cost-effectiveness could come from energy efficiency without well-maintenance.

    "explanation": "The statement asks whether every ergonomic VR headset has motion tracking. The given information says that if a headset is ergonomic, it has a wide field of view (Premise 4), and if it has a wide field of view, it has motion tracking (Premise 5). Take an ergonomic headset—let’s call it headset Y. Since it’s ergonomic, Premise 4 says it has a wide field of view. Because it has a wide field of view, Premise 5 says it has motion tracking. So, every ergonomic headset ends up with motion tracking, making the statement true."
